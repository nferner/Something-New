# Something-New
This is something new, to look forward to. 
I was listening to Spoon on the train ride home today and fell asleep. During my sleep I dreamed of my girlfriend flipping her hair in the air. The white was where a guy from the 1950s might have the curl at the tip of his head...like John Travolta in "Grease". When I saw her white hair juxtaposed to her dark brown I was taken aback by her beauty and the brazeness with which she proclaimed and cherrished the white (age implied) hair she had. Her confidence was sexy as hell. I loved seeing it and being a part of it.
